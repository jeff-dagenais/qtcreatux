This little program (which normally should have been a python script...) simply reads the autogenerated files created by the kernels `make prepare` and dumps a qmake syntax'd file (autoconf.qmk) containing the proper defines. This file can then be included into a pro file which indexes the kernel source. The result is a properly highlighted browsing experience.

=Usage=
# create a directory where you'll build the kernel
# copy over an existing `.config` or
## create a new one using `make O=/build/directory/you/created ARCH=?? defconfig` (or `menuconfig` or whatever you prefer)
# make `make O=/build/directory/you/created ARCH=?? prepare`
# `cd build/directory/you/created`
# `kconfig2qmk`
# `genlinuxpro`

`genlinux`Â will generate a file named after the top-level directory it's in. This .pro can be opened by qt-creator for browsing and editing.

I personnaly replace the qmake-make build steps with kernel specific build and deploy steps. Making the integration more seamless.
